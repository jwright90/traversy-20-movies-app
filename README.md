# Movies App

My take on Brad Traversy's movies app on Udemy \
https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/

## Lessons learned

- Ensuring callbacks are fired at the right time, e.g. not resetting dropdown list if add movie button is clicked and no movie has been entered.

* require can only be used with node.js
* the ability to use build commands when deploying to netlify

## What would I do differently next time?

- Continuous deployment, because it wasn't until the end of the project I realised I couldn't use .env in a regular Javascript project
