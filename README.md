## Lessons learned

- Developing full CRUD applications from scratch takes a lot of time

## To dos

### 17th Oct 2021

- Complete the add movies functionality by storing movies in local storage
- Re-design the app to look more appealing. Discuss what you learned during making the app.
- Lessons could be:
  - Using async / await when updating movie lists, because the list was updating after getting sorted. I needed to wait for the new movie to be added before sorting the data.
  - Getting working with indexes within arrays, storing indexes in local storage and then looping through an existing array and changing only the indexes stored in local storage
  - The need to cover every case, e.g. what if nothing can be found in local storage? What is the logic to cover this case?
