# Movies App

My take on Brad Traversy's movies app on Udemy \
https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/

## What did I enjoy about building this project?

- Combining different concepts I've learned from many small tutorials into one project

## What did I find the most challenging?

- Organising my code. It became really tough to understand how each bit of code related to parts of the code, even when I tried to split all the files out into easier to understand blocks, it was still difficult.

## What did I learn?

- Ensuring callbacks are fired at the right time, e.g. not resetting dropdown list if add movie button is clicked and no movie has been entered.
- require can only be used with node.js
- The ability to use build commands when deploying to netlify

## What would I do differently next time?

- Continuous deployment, because it wasn't until the end of the project I realised I couldn't use .env in a regular Javascript project. Getting the API to work gave me issues, amongst other bugs I found only after deployment.
- If this were a real life project for a client I would of course use frameworks, probably React / Next.js as that's what I'm the most comfortable with at the moment. I would also use a database instead of local storage.

## What should I learn next?

- I'd like to learn how to test my code using jest or cypress, though not sure it relates much to this project.
